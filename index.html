            <b>Victimisation</b> refers to the process of being made a victim of
            a crime or unfair treatment. It involves individuals experiencing
            <b>harm, suffering, or loss</b> due to the actions of others.
            Victimisation can occur in various forms, including
            <b>physical assault, theft, and emotional abuse</b>. Understanding
            victimisation is crucial for developing
            <b>effective prevention strategies and providing support</b> to
            those affected.

            From 2008 to 2022, physical assault victimisation rates in Australia
            have generally <b>declined</b> across all age groups and sexes.
            <b>Males, especially those aged 15-29</b>, consistently had higher
            rates compared to females. The overall downward trend suggests
            improvements in
            <b>public safety measures or changes in reporting practices</b> over
            the years. This decline highlights the effectiveness of
            <b>targeted interventions and increased awareness</b> about personal
            safety.
